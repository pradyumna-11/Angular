Ex-12
a) Write MongoDB queries to Create and drop databases and collections.

Refer to Exp-11 to connect with cluster and perform these.
When you create a database until one collection is created in database it will not show the database name when used show dbs.

show dbs- to check databases available in cluster

use databaseName - it creates and uses database which having database name as databaseName

db.dropdatabase() - To delete database

show collections - To show all the collections available

db.createCollection("collectionName") - To create a collection with given name in braces

db.collectionname.drop() - To drop or delete the collection


b)Write MongoDB queries to work with records using find(), limit(), sort(), createIndex(), aggregate(). 

db.users.find({ age: { $gte: 18 } }) - Finds all users aged 18 or older.

db.users.find().limit(5) - Returns only the first 5 documents.

db.users.find().sort({ age: -1 }) - Sorts users by age in descending order.

db.users.createIndex({ email: 1 }) - Creates an ascending index on the email field for faster queries.

db.orders.aggregate([
  { $match: { status: "delivered" } },
  { $group: { _id: "$customerId", totalSpent: { $sum: "$amount" } } },
  { $sort: { totalSpent: -1 } },
  { $limit: 5 }
]) - Finds top 5 customers by total spending on delivered orders.
